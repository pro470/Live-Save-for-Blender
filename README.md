I DO NOT SAVE MY BLENDER PROJECTS.

As an aspiring VFX artist, I was always looking for ways to improve my skills and workflow. I started learning Blender, but as a beginner entrepreneur, I didn't have the high-end hardware to handle the software, which would often crash and cause me to lose progress. Despite my frustrations, I was determined to learn Blender and take my skills to the next level.

Fortunately, I also worked with DaVinci Resolve, which had a feature called "Live Save," which would save everything I changed or made. This feature was a lifesaver for me, and it kept me from losing all of my progress and projects. But when I tried using Blender, I realized there was no similar feature available. I knew I had to find a solution, and that's when I decided to create Live Save for Blender.

As an entrepreneur, I faced many challenges in creating this add-on. I was new to coding and had to learn everything from scratch. It took me months to develop and test the add-on, and there were many times when I wanted to give up. But I was determined to make this work and to create a solution for Blender users like myself.

I reached out to the Blender community and received a lot of support and encouragement. I shared my vision for Live Save for Blender, and many people were excited about the prospect of having a reliable and efficient saving system for Blender.

the lack of a reliable saving system for Blender users. As a beginner, I lost a lot of progress and projects due to the software crashing or not having an automatic saving feature. I knew I had to find a solution to this problem, not only for myself but for others who were struggling with the same issue.

we considered reinventing the saving system to add a new twist. We wanted to make Live Save for Blender not just a simple saving feature but a comprehensive system that could automatically save versions, undo and redo actions, and even backup projects to the cloud or a Database. We wanted to create something that would truly make a difference for Blender users and take their workflow to the next level.

As I continued to work on Live Save for Blender, I faced many challenges and setbacks. There were times when the code wouldn't compile, or the add-on wouldn't work as expected. I had to go back to the drawing board and rethink my approach. But every time I faced a challenge, I was reminded of the importance of this project and the impact it could have on the Blender community. I knew I had to keep going and find a way to make Live Save for Blender a reality.

After months of hard work and dedication, Live Save for Blender was finally ready. The add-on offered a comprehensive saving system that could automatically save versions, undo and redo actions, and backup projects to the cloud. Blender users could finally have peace of mind knowing that their work was being saved automatically, and they wouldn't lose progress or projects due to software crashes.

In conclusion, Live Save for Blender is a project that is close to my heart. It's a story of determination, perseverance, and the power of community support. I hope that Live Save for Blender will make a difference in the lives of many Blender users and help them take their skills to the next level. If you have any ideas or code that could help improve Live Save for Blender, please don't hesitate to reach out. Together, we can make this add-on even better and help more people in the process.

IT IS STILL IN BETA BUT HOPE TO RELEASE A COMPLETE VERSION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
